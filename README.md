I am Stephanie Ngu. I'm double-majoring in Computer Science & Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Stony Brook University. I enjoy working with Python and Java, and I'm especially interested in pursuing a career in data science and machine learning. Currently, I am a fellow in Break Through Tech @ Cornell Tech, where I've been working on building, training, and testing machine learning models with the Airbnb dataset!
